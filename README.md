### Ribo-seq 3 nt periodicity plot 
This code was used for plotting the 3-nt periodicity from Ribo-seq data together with the RNA-seq result.  

#### What is required:
A gtf file (make sure the 1st column (chromosome name) is numeric, e.g. 10, not Chr10)  
A bam file for the corresponding RNA-seq reads  
A txt file generated from RiboTaper output p_sites_all file that containing p-site counts, p-site position, chromosome info, strand info.
